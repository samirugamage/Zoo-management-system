#Project Overview
                This project addresses significant operational challenges faced by zoos in Sri Lanka due to reliance on outdated,                  manual methods of record-keeping and management.

#Problem Statement
                Current issues include difficulties in maintaining accurate data, potential loss of vital animal histories,                 inefficient food consumption tracking, and limitations in fundraising and public education regarding animal rights and                 habitats.

#Proposed Solution
                my proposed solution is a web-based system designed to revolutionize zoo management and public education efforts.

#Key Features
                Efficient Record-Keeping: Streamlined and accurate data management, reducing the risk of losing critical animal information.

                Animal Food Consumption and Treatment Management: Enables efficient tracking of food consumption and medical                 treatments, ensuring animal welfare and resource optimization.

                Charity Event Management: A dedicated module for organizing and promoting charity events to increase fundraising                 capabilities.

#Public Education: A platform to educate the public about animal rights, habitats, and conservation efforts.

#User Groups
                The system caters to various user groups, including website administrators, zoologists, staff members, and the                 general public, providing each with appropriate access levels and capabilities.

#Impact
                By implementing this web-based system, zoos in Sri Lanka can effectively overcome their operational challenges,                 fulfill their intended purposes more efficiently, and contribute more effectively to global conservation                                 initiatives.
